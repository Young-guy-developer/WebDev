                <p>
                    Legacy of Phrecia is an event. In this event, the original 19 ascendancy classes are replaced with more unusual ascendancy classes that are "whacky ideas that never quite made it off the brainstorm board", and the Atlas passive skill tree is replaced with the Idol system.

                    The Dawn of the Hunt League
                    Start fresh in a new economy with the Dawn of the Hunt league. All of your old characters from the Early Access launch are still present but a free passive tree refund has been granted due to the changes. We would highly encourage you to join the new leagues to fully take in the changes we've made with the 0.2.0 update.
